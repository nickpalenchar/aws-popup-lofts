# hello

# Problems

Many experiments need powerful instances > experiments add up. Billing!

# Governance in 3 phases
1. Control - prevent actions that you don't desire
2. Monitor - insight into what's going on in your aws account
3. Fix - action to take against what is monitored.

## Control

Prevent actions such as
+ CloudFormation
+ Service Catalog
+ IAM Policies (huge!!)
+ Disable Root Credentials
+ Check Github for access keys available publcly.

### Cloud Formation
Use existing development tools with cloud formation.

Service Catelog can extend cloudFormation use.

EG. Define a base line application stack, make it available through service catalog. Other devs can explore those.
+ You can set limts on how many of each catalog can be used.

Cloud Trail. Actions that get recorded.
